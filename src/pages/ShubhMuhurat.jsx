                                    <p>Shubh Muhurat 2022: Date and Time</p>
                                    <p>There is surely no need for us to convince you of the importance of Shubh Muhurat
                                        in 2022. From performing a simple pooja to sending rockets to the Moon, Indians
                                        have always relied on Shubh muhurats to start any kind of auspicious task. And
                                        with always, we really mean back from the Vedic times when sages actually
                                        started the practice of finding the Shubh muhurats for different purposes.
                                        Thereafter, as Hinduism grew, so did the belief that if any auspicious and
                                        demanding work is to be done, it must be done during the right ticks of the
                                        clock.</p>
                                    <p>But the question is, how does one decide whether the given time is right or
                                        wrong? Or how does all this Shubh muhurat thing actually work? Well, if you ask
                                        our astrologers, they will surely tell you various dimensions to take note of
                                        when it comes to finding a Shubh muhurat. But here, we will try to explain all
                                        of it to you in a very simple way.</p>
                                    <p>In astrology, to find the Shubh Muhurat 2022, one of the main things that our
                                        astrologers consider is the planetary moment. We have as many as nine planets in
                                        astrology, also called Navgrah. And these planets, at any point in time, occupy
                                        one of the 12 houses in your Kundli. These 12 houses relate to finance, love,
                                        health, marriage, foreign travel, enemies, children etc.</p>
                                    <p>Now if one seeks to marry in 2022, and wants to find the Shubh Muhurat for
                                        marriage in 2022, astrologers will do so by first looking at their kundli. Among
                                        other things - like whether you are Manglik or not - the astrologer will have a
                                        look at the House of marriage in your kundli and what planet is occupying it at
                                        a particular point in time. For example, if the planet Rahu is placed in the
                                        house of marriage, that day may not be the best for you to marry. However, if
                                        the planet Sun is in the house of marriage, then it could be an auspicious time
                                        for you to marry. This way, both the boy’s and the girl’s kundlis
                                        are matched. And at the end, we have the auspicious time aka Shubh muhurat for
                                        marriage by our side.</p>
                                    <p>Now for the ones who seek to have the sophisticated definition of Shubh muhurat,
                                        our astrologers define it as a particular time during which the position of
                                        planetary constellations in the solar system is auspicious for a person.</p>
                                    <h5>Importance of finding shubh muhurat in 2022</h5>
                                    <p>With everything going modern, one may wonder why we still consider finding an
                                        auspicious time in 2022 to begin a particular thing or two. Well, the answer is
                                        pretty simple. When we are doing anything, our first intention is to have
                                        success. And to have this success, our mind looks for every possible means.
                                        Surely we work hard, but an extra pinch of luck by your side would not hurt,
                                        right? Having said that, astrology comes to one’s rescue. In astrology, it
                                        is believed that the planets and constellations are the medium of energies. And
                                        having their energy can allow us the positivity that we need to accomplish
                                        something at hand. This is the only reason why one needs to find the Shubh
                                        Muhurat before commencing a task.</p>
                                    <p>This tradition of finding Shubh muhurat has its history from Vedic times. Sages
                                        back in those days used to propose to the kings that they should only do things
                                        after analysing the auspiciousness of the time, even when starting a war. Doing
                                        so keeps at bay the hindrances that may fall upon and adds positivity.</p>
                                    <p>It is very interesting to know that although most of the modern generation do not
                                        consider many of the Vedic things. However, somewhere in the back of their mind,
                                        they always do consider finding the Shubh muhurat when starting anything new.
                                        From Bollywood to politics, from worshipping expensive cars to worshipping the
                                        Rafale Jets, time and again we have proved the legitimacy of the science of
                                        finding Shubh muhurat, and thankfully, continue to do so.</p>
                                    <p>Even if you ever give a read to Hindu sculptures or texts, especially the Vedic
                                        texts, you will find for yourself that many of these texts have a mention of
                                        Shubh muhurat and their importance. Even many Gods, back in time when
                                        Ravana's son was about to be born, had asked the planets in astrology to
                                        move to an inappropriate position just to make sure Ravana’s son is not
                                        born at an auspicious time. This story itself proves the legitimacy of Shubh
                                        Muhurats and why they are considered a benevolent force in shaping our life.</p>
                                    <h5>How do astrologers find Shubh Muhurats?</h5>
                                    <p>After pinpointing the impedance of Shubh muhurat, now we shall have a look at how
                                        our astrologers find Shubh Muhurat 2022. While a small gist of the same question
                                        has been mentioned in the first paragraph, here is an elongated version of the
                                        same. To find the Shubh Muhurat 2022 in Hindi, apart from the position of the
                                        planets, we also consider other astrological elements like - Tithi, Nakshatra,
                                        Shubh yoga, inauspicious yoga, Lagna, Rahu kaal, Bhadra, Adhik maas, etc.</p>
                                    <p>Based on these terms, which many won’t understand, the auspicious and also
                                        the inauspicious time of the year are found. While the former is called the
                                        Shubh muhurat, the latter, on the other hand, is found to allow you an idea of
                                        when to not do something. Because if you try to do things at this time, it is
                                        more likely that you won’t find success or may have to face many hurdles.
                                        Thus, whenever trying to find the Shubh Muhurat 2022, also consider having
                                        knowledge of inauspicious timings too.</p>
                                    <p>As per astrology, throughout the day, i.e., 24 hours, there are as many as 30
                                        shubh muhurats for doing different things. Each muhurat stays for at least 48
                                        minutes. One should try to complete an important task within these 48 minutes.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Types of Shubh Muhurat 2022</h5>
                                    <p>Like we said, a 24-hour long day has 30 muhurats in it. The first muhurat, i.e.
                                        Rudra Muhurat, begins at 6 AM and goes on for as long as 48 minutes. However,
                                        this is an inauspicious muhurat and is not considered viable to begin a new
                                        task. Once the Rudra muhurat ends, then comes the Ahi Muhurta and it also comes
                                        under the category of an inauspicious Muhurta. Apart from these two Muhurtas,
                                        here are all the 28 other Shubh muhurats that fall in a day.</p>

                                    <p>When we try to find Shubh Muhurat, mainly five things are considered to ensure
                                        the best time of the day is at your service. These 5 things are: Panchang Tithi,
                                        Vaar, Nakshatra, Yoga and Karan. Based on these, the auspicious time in 2022 is
                                        found. Now we shall discuss these one-by-one.</p>
                                    <h5>Panchang Tithi</h5>
                                    <p>Tithi is one of the elements of Hindu panchang. It is very important to know the
                                        Tithi to find the Shubh Muhurat. A Tithi is the duration of two phases of the
                                        Moon that are observed from the Earth. As per astrology, there are as many as 30
                                        Tithis in a month. Out of these, 15 fall in Shukla Paksha and the remaining 15
                                        in the Krishna paksha. A tithi begins from one sunrise and continues till the
                                        other sunrise.</p>
                                    <p>However, at some times, two dates may fall on the same day. Of these, the tithi
                                        which does not see the sunrise is called the Kshya titihi and the one which
                                        lasts till two sunrise is called Vrishy tithi.</p>
                                    <h5>Here are the names of Krishna Paksha and Shukla Paksha:</h5>
                                    <p><strong>Krishna Paksha tithis -&nbsp;</strong>Pratipada, Dwitiya, Tritiya,
                                        Chaturthi, Panchami, Shashti, Saptami, Ashtami, Navami, Dashami, Ekadashi,
                                        Dwadashi, Trayodashi, Chaturdashi, Amavasya</p>
                                    <p><strong>Shukla Paksha tithis -&nbsp;</strong>Pratipada, Dwitiya, Tritiya,
                                        Chaturthi, Panchami, Shashti, Saptami, Ashtami, Navami, Dashami, Ekadashi,
                                        Dwadashi, Trayodashi, Chaturdashi, Poornima</p>
                                    <h5>Vaar</h5>
                                    <p>The second important thing when it comes to finding the Shubh muhurat 2022 is
                                        Vaar. As per the Hindu calendar, there are as many as 7 Vaars in each week.
                                        These are - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. All
                                        the Vaars in astrology are said to have their own characteristics.</p>
                                    <p>Like every other thing, each Vaar supports a thing or two. A good example here is
                                        how Muslims consider Friday as one of the most auspicious Vaar. Similarly, some
                                        Vaars are good for marriage, others for mundan, etc. In astrology, Tuesday,
                                        Sunday and Thursday are considered good in many ways.</p>
                                    <h5>Nakshatra</h5>
                                    <p>Nakshatras are nothing but constellations that we see in the sky. Whatever
                                        constellation is the Moon passing through at a particular point in time becomes
                                        the Nakshatra for the day. Back in the times of Sages, though they knew of
                                        zodiac signs, however, for better clarity, they divided the 12 zodiac signs into
                                        27 nakshatras. Each Nakshatra is approximately a day long and has its own
                                        characteristics. While some nakshatras are good for a particular task. Others,
                                        on the other hand, may not be good. Thus when finding out the Shubh Muhurat in
                                        2022 you must only abide by a muhurat that falls on good nakshatra.</p>

                                        which Shubh Muhurat 2022 can be found. Among the 27 yogas, nine are very
                                        inauspicious while all the remaining are considered auspicious. Doing any task
                                        during the inauspicious Yogas is considered bad. Here is all that you need to
                                        know about the 27 yogas and their nature-</p>
